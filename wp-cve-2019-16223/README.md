# Wordpress cve-2019-16223   
## Vulnerability description  

The disclosed vulnerability allows a remote attacker to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the post previews by contributors functionality. A remote attacker can trick the victim to follow a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to steal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.

## How to use    
Set in /etc/host  
```  
<dsp-ip> dsp.com   
```   
And navigate wordpress:  

http://dsp.com:11080/wp-login.php 

Contributor creds:  
```   
contributor/contributor  
``` 
## Proof of Concept   
The vulnerability is due to two condition: 
1. wp_kses_bad_protocol_once() has an issue with URL sanitization that can be passed and can lead to cross-site scripting vulnerability:   

the function sanitizes bad protocols, and applies a convertion of HTML entities to avoid bypass techniques; anyway, in vulnerable versions, it only checks for html entities after two points, as it is possible to 
observe by the applied fix: 

```
function wp_kses_bad_protocol_once( $string, $allowed_protocols, $count = 1 ) {
+	$string  = preg_replace( '/(&#0*58(?![;0-9])|&#x0*3a(?![;a-f0-9]))/i', '$1;', $string );   # APPLIED FIX AFTER VULNERABILITY DETECTION 
	$string2 = preg_split( '/:|&#0*58;|&#x0*3a;/i', $string, 2 );
	if ( isset( $string2[1] ) && ! preg_match( '%/\?%', $string2[0] ) ) {

```
This allows an attacker to inject attack strings such as:    

```
<a href="javascript&#58alert(document.domain)">Example Attack</a>
```
Anyway, Wordpress protects against this attack because it converts any type of html entities during the rendering of posts. In a particular case, during preview, it is possible to inject html entities in a URL. That is the second condition. 


2. During preview, get_the_content() function in post-template.php replaces URL encoded characters with a corresponding HTML entity: 

```
function get_the_content( $more_link_text = null, $strip_teaser = false ) {

    ...
    if ( $preview ) // Preview fix for JavaScript bug with foreign languages.
        $output =   preg_replace_callback( '/\%u([0-9A-F]{4})/', '_convert_urlencoded_to_entities', $output );

    return $output;
}

function _convert_urlencoded_to_entities( $match ) {
    return '&#' . base_convert( $match[1], 16, 10 ) . ';';
}



```
For this reason, it is possible to send URL encoded strings that will be converted in HTML entities during preview. HTML entities can be crafted to bypass wp_ses_bad_protocol_once() function due to issue described in condition 1. 

Proof Of Concept:  
1. Create a new post
2. Insert in code editor the following HTML PoC code:   

<a href="javascript%u003Aalert(/XSS/)">poc</a>

3. Click on preview and click the "poc" link   


Solution: 

Upgrade Wordpress to version >= 5.2.3
